# KotlinTutorial
Kotlin Tutorial for Programming Languages Seminar. To prepare for the Tutorial, please follow the steps below. 

## Install Intellij

Install the Intellij IDEA Community Edition (free) on your local machine, following the Installation Guide on https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/installation-guide.html.

## Get Project from Github
1. In IntelliJ, open the "File" Menu.
2. Hover over "New..." and select "Project from Version Control".
3. Enter the Github URL: https://github.com/carolernst-uzh/KotlinTutorial and clone the project.
4. Navigate to scr/main/kotlin to find the two templates for the interactive tutorial.

Note: You don't have to run the templates before the session (which may not work anyhow), just have them ready and open to look at together. 

## Familiarize yourself with the basic syntax
Take 10 minutes to have a look at the basic syntax structure on https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/kotlin/.

## Final git pull
Before the start of the tutorial, ideally do another quick "git pull" command in the terminal to be sure you are on the latest version of the template.
